# Coding and Technical QA — XAUWatch v0.3.0

Date: 2026-07-16 (Asia/Bangkok)

## Status

```text
Mode: Continue Project
Current phase: Phase 9 — Coding and Technical QA
Latest approved gate: Gate 6 — Development Handoff (carried from approved conversation)
Known: Android-first PWA, XAUUSD M5–M15, Bias/Action/Trigger separation, Thai command input
Assumed: Next.js/Vercel remains the approved MVP platform; Twelve Data remains the initial market provider
Blocked: broader physical Android device matrix remains outside this session
Next decision: physical-device install/UAT before final Gate 7 acceptance
```

## Automated checks

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ESLint | Pass | `npm run lint` — 0 findings |
| TypeScript | Pass | `npm run typecheck` |
| Unit tests | Pass | `npm run test` — 3/3 |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build` — Next.js 16.2.10, all routes generated |
| Dependency audit | Pass | `npm install` audit — 0 vulnerabilities after PostCSS override |
| Contrast | Pass | `node scripts/contrast.mjs` — all tested pairs ≥ 6.50:1 |
| Runtime smoke | Pass | `node scripts/smoke.mjs` — `/`, health, market, analyze; manual price 4022; stale data → WAIT |
| Live provider smoke | Pass | Production health reports `ai: true`, `market: true`; analysis `source: ai`, market `source: twelve-data`, `stale: false`, `fallback: false` |
| Performance browser QA | Pass | First uncached demo flow showed Dashboard within 800ms; repeat load DOM ready ≈60ms and Dashboard visible within 100ms |
| Static payload reduction | Pass | `.next/static` ≈1.3MB → 876KB; font media 616KB → 200KB |

## Hallmark audit

- Pre-emit critique: Philosophy 5, Hierarchy 5, Execution 4, Specificity 5, Restraint 5, Variety 4.
- Code-inspectable slop gates pass, including token discipline, honest copy, purposeful terminal cursor, N8 nav, Ft4 footer, focus/reduced-motion support, and mobile static rules.
- Gates 34 and 49 remain **not visually verified**, not passed: no horizontal overflow and no wrapping interactive labels must be inspected at 320, 375, 414, 768, and 1280×800.

## Acceptance traceability

| Requirement | Implementation | Test status |
|---|---|---|
| Current price and freshness | `lib/market.ts`, market hero | Live Twelve Data M5 production smoke passed |
| Bias vs action | schema + decision panel | Unit/runtime pass |
| M5/M15/H1 | structured analysis + timeframe strip | Runtime pass |
| Support/resistance | schema + levels section | Runtime pass |
| Entry/SL/TP/invalidation | structured plan + plan section | Schema/unit pass |
| Thai analysis command | `/api/analyze` + command form | Runtime pass with rule fallback |
| Conversation continuity | `previous_response_id` | Live OpenAI response ID verified |
| Android install | manifest + icons + service worker | HTTPS/PWA assets pass; physical-device install UAT pending |
| Private provider keys | server-only environment variables | Static review pass |
| Stale data safety | forced WAIT + warning | Unit/runtime pass |

## Open limitations and risks

1. Twelve Data Basic 8 has finite request limits; the 45-second cache and split refresh cadence reduce quota pressure but do not remove it.
2. Physical Android installation and touch checks remain open across the intended device matrix.
3. This is decision support only. It does not place orders and must not represent stale/demo values as live prices.

## Gate recommendation

Core technical readiness passes. Complete physical Android install/touch UAT before final Gate 7 acceptance.
